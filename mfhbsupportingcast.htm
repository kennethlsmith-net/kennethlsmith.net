<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Ruth Perrott (May 30, 1899 - January 6, 1996) also worked with Lou Costello in
<i>The 30-Foot Bride of Candy Rock</i>(1959).  She played the role of Aunt May.  Gail Gordon also played a role
in this same film. Ruth played a number of "bit" roles throughout the 1950s and 1960s including programs such
as <i>Boston Blackie</i>, <i>Dragnet</i>, <i>I Love Lucy</i>,
<i>Dear Phoebe</i>, and <i>How to Marry a Millionaire</i>.

</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Gale Gordon (February 20, 1906 - June 30, 1995) was an American character actor.
Remembered best as Lucille Ball's longtime television foil -- and particularly as cantankerously combusitble,
tightfisted bank executive Theodore J. Mooney, on Ball's second television situation comedy,
<i>The Lucy Show</i> -- Gordon was just as respected for his earlier career in classic American radio, where
he was once the highest paid actor in the medium, even though he was never a top-billed radio star.</br ></br >
Gale Gordon and Bea Benaderet were both given first consideration for the roles that would become Fred Mertz
and Ethel Mertz on "I Love Lucy", but both had contract conflicts that forced them to turn down the roles.

<p style="font-size: 0.8em"><b><i>Mrs. Iris Atterbury</i></b>, played by Bea Benaderet; wife of Rudolph and friend of
the Cooper family, refers to female acquaintances as "girl", as in "Liz-Girl."
</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Benaderet (April 4, 1906 - October 13, 1968) first received notice for her radio work
in the 1940s playing Millicent Carstairs on <i>Fibber McGee & Molly</i>, telephone operator Gertrude Gearshift on
<i>The Jack Benny Program</i>, school principal Eve Goodwin on <i>The Great Gildersleeve</i> and appeared on
several <i>Amos 'n Andy</i> radio shows, usually as a store clerk trying to assist Andy and Kingfish in a purchase.
Benaderet also played Blance Morton, next door neighbor to George Burns and Gracie Allen, on both 
radio and television.

She played Lucille Ball's best friend, Iris Atterbury, on the <i>My Favorite Husband</i> radio
series.  When Ball and husband Desi Arnaz decided to create a very similar television series called <i>
I Love Lucy</i>, Benaderet was first choice to fill the role of Ethel Mertz but
was unavailable to take the role since she had already signed for <i>Burns and Allen's</i> television
adaptation of their radio program.  Vivian Vance, an almost unkown character actress and singer,
was eventually cast in the part.  Benaderet did get to guest on <i>I Love Lucy</i> on January 12, 1952, in
a very amusing appearance as Miss Lewis, a love-starved spinster neighbor.
