The following is an example of a reserved target name.  Reserved target 
names are special names that can be used in place of a frame name as targets.
I used the reserved target name "_self" which overwrites the target specified in
the <base> tag and instructs the browser to open the page in the same frame that
contains the link.
   As stated in our text, the technique employed here is commonly used for tables
of content that double as links.  Clicking the "Cast" link gives the effect that
the list is expanding and contracting, but in reality, one table of contents file
is simply replaced by another.  -- Session 5.2, pages 262-265 (8th of 8 required
