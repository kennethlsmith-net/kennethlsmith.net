<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Denning became a "free-lance" actor not tied to any one studio.  He worked
at Paramount, Republic, RKO and Fox -- but, again, in pictures better left forgotten.  In July, 1948, Lucille
Ball starred in a one-shot radio program entitled, "My Favorite Husband," based on the book, "Mr and Mrs. Cugat,"
by Isabel Scott Rorick.  Movie actor Lee Bowman played her husband.  CBS was in dire need of new product,
and when the reviews to "Husband" turned out to be glowing, the network wanted to turn the
property into a weekly series immediately.  Bowman was not available -- but Richard Denning was.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Richard Denning passed away on October 11, 1998.  Considered a "classically
handsome" movie and television actor, Denning was perhaps best known for his role as the governor of
Hawaii in the long-running Jack Lord television series, Hawaii Five-O.  Denning was 85.  He had suffered
from emphysema for many years -- and was forced to turn down an invitation to attend our Loving Lucy '98
recreation of My Favorite Husband in July of that year, when his doctors felt it not wise for him
to travel from his home in Escondido, California.
